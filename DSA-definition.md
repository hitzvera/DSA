### Definition

is a way to organize data so it can be used effectively.

### Why

1. essential parts in creating powerful and fast algorithm.
2. helping in managing and organizing data
3. make code cleaner and easier to understand.

### abstract data type

ADT is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only interfaces to which data structure must adhere to.

interface does not only have detail implementation and not coupled to specific programming language.

examples

| abstract data type (ADT) | Detailed implementation (DS)                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List                     | Dynamic Array, Linked List                                    |
| Queue                    | Linked list based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue |
| Map                      | Tree Map, Hash Map/ Hash table                                |
| Vehicle                  | Golf Cart, Bicycle, Smart car                                 |
